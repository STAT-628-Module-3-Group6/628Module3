Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.\n\nMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.\n\n*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. \n\nThe staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.\n\nThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat.", "user_id": "6vU0I5XgCv9OQHZ76rV6qw", "review_id": "RHhlmL07evgAdPaXQV8Omg", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "business_id": "QXAEGFB4oINsVuTFxEYKFQ"}, {"stars": 4.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2016-08-13 20:31:21", "text": "I've been a frequent at this place for years, enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family.

My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings, events, gatherings, and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time, it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated, but maybe this has changed?\n\nFOOD! I honestly think it's great here, though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum, letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person, so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol), the siu mai, dumplings, they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here, they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.\n\nSERVICE is all pretty good too imo, a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too, bringing drinks/sauces/plates when we ask right away. \n\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to people!

In March this year, I walked into the men's room to find a floor covered in vomit! In most restaurants, this would be cleaned up immediately.\n\nFrom Day 1, I felt the rudeness and aggression from the wait staff. In particular, an elderly heavy set Waiter who actually scowls when serving or taking orders.\n\nI once brought some European guests of ours fresh from the Airport for Dinner and they were shocked/disgusted by the rudeness. My friend asked the Waiter if he had a problem and if all Canadians are this rude lol! The bill was about $70 and we did not give him a penny of tips.\n\nSo, back to the service.

This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers, YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. \n\nThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times, you just have to be patient. The ladies (never seen a dude wheeling the carts) will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table (for which you will be charged), so you have to say No multiple times. \n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin. I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily, the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different, so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I'd find growing between my toenails, but tasted like heaven should taste.

Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so I'm a little behind. The place is huge - banquet style seating. They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so it's very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTA.\n\nThe choice is yours: Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu. From their \"Har Gau\" shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings, you can always find something good to eat here. When I first arrived at Emerald, I didn't quite know what to expect. It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby. What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy. I am telling you all, the food is very good here.\n\nDim sum carts: Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay. Noodles and veggies are cheaper. Seafood items are higher in cost. If you love seafood as much as I do, you won't mind paying for it.\n\nMenu: I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great. If you order the crab, it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget. When dining here with out-of-town family or friends, I would always recommend buying the crab.\n\nSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment. You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service. As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays, I'm listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the \"five-star\" eating experience.\n\nTip #1: Plan wisely - Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse. Unless you are absolutely craving their food, beware of rushed and rude service.\nTip #2: All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts. You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price. But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out. The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours. I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishes.\nTip #3: When you need some service, get their attention! Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests. They are the ones you need to order from so don't be shy and call them over. \nTip #4: When asking for something, no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you. When speaking with us needy/hungry/polite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders. Just say what you need and follow up when they forget. If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcome.\n\nFor more food reviews and blogging, check out my blog at https://spicychopsticks.blog", "user_id": "r85-TiGOr3QABRv0gmaDEw", "review_id": "KVhgCjR_J27_-5hU4RR-Fw", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "business_id": "QXAEGFB4oINsVuTFxEYKFQ"}, {"stars": 1.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2012-03-12 17:40:38", "text": "We came all the way from New York to try this restaurant because it was recommended by some friends.

I give the server props for observing my caucasian clients did not like it and quickly came to the rescue with fortune cookies -to that my client were like \"Yea! Awesome!\"\n\nIt could be five star, but two reasons stopped me.\n\nFirst, at a previous visit for dim sum, I found that when I had caucasian clients with kids, the servers take advantage of the kids amusement with crab claw dim sums because kids like playing with food.  I will honestly say it's pretty pricey to order half a dozen of premium dim sum dishes.\n\nSecond, this restaurant does not serve any dishes that are diabetic/high cholesterol customers.  I can never take health sensitive clients for dim sum and the dinner options really don't have clean options.", "user_id": "I5S5BV-n2XhYFjCLTwZIjg", "review_id": "nWl2WRz53qDkYs11WNQh7w", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "business_id": "QXAEGFB4oINsVuTFxEYKFQ"}, {"stars": 1.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2018-10-24 02:14:28", "text": "This place has hands down the worst food and service that I have experienced in a while. \nThe decor was super tacky.

Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds, fish tank, things weren't new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.\n\nThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular \u00e0 la carte menu. My table ordered off the \u00e0 la carte, probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.\n\nThe soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible, but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place, literally.\n\nOther dishes came out eventually, featuring sweet and sour pork, thousand island sauce deep fried pork, egg tofu with baby shrimp, garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce, XO sauce string beans, fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home, but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done, though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard, nothing special.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either, which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party.

If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls.

The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture.

For three years, I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes. Both of which are truly amazing! Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it, and the broth is fantastic!\n\nMy last visit (which was last Thursday), I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it, and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any meal.\n\nThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off by some sliding doors. It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit.  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to it.\n\nThe Staff is always friendly and kind, and you really could not ask for any better. They always feel very attentive to their customers. If your glass of tea is nearly empty, someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.\n\nMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame it is so far away from me, but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic sushi, tempura, or ramen, this is the place to go!", "user_id": "sAJeQJk7PUv2EhoWc8PxJw", "review_id": "3-fKckBw55CfxTWMH7EYoA", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}, {"stars": 4.0, "cool": 1, "date": "2017-08-04 20:51:27", "text": "This is a completely legit, traditional Japanese-owned sushi restaurant, which is a bit of a rarity anywhere in the United States outside of a major city like NY, LA, Chicago, DC or Miami let alone North Carolina.

Their cooked items are delicious too: grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps, any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles. Pair any of these items with some sake or beer.\n\nFYI - They take reservations and have a large separate room (shoes must be taken off) with two tables that can seat 8-10 ppl each. For these tables, you sit on the floor and legs can hang below. They have set lunch and dinner hours, and never pick up the phone unless they're open and not too busy.

I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll.

This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous eaters!\n\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n\nBefore I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure?

I would definitely come back, though it is a little far out from the city (20 min drive).\n\nYou'll notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home. There's a private dining room, which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats, sliding doors and pillows.The owners are also japanese, which is always a good sign in my books if you're looking for some lip-smacking ramen. \n\nThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan, ranging from potato croquettes (with the delicious bulldog brand sauce) to gyoza and even mini fried crabs. Ramen is by far, the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths, soy, miso, tonkotsu etc.\n\nThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect. I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almost-creamy texture of the broth, filled with the rich flavor of pork. The soup also has a great milky-color. Unfortunately the noodles aren't hand made and you can tell they're more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles. However, this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl. I didn't leave one drop!\n\nThe restaurant serves alcohol, but not past a certain hour (like 9 or 10), so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki. Perfect accompaniment to dinner.

Texture similar to conch.\nDumplings - I usually don't love dumplings in Japanese restaurants, but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an order.\n\nSushi/Sashimi is outstanding - they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonable.\nSoba/Udon - delicious noodles and clear or dark broth...haven't tried the cold Soba, but that's my next step. \n\nThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu, and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that non-Gaijin menu!! She said she would be happy to do so!\n\nTo heck with the strip mall atmosphere - this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who don't want to dress up like they're going clubbing don't want disco balls and sake bombs (sorry Nikko and Enso).", "user_id": "21QNv2Y-DJv6KC8JaT38fg", "review_id": "py1RexHZMMNPkfXLiV2xLg", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}, {"stars": 5.0, "cool": 1, "date": "2018-02-17 21:47:30", "text": "Words can't express how good this place is fo authentic Sushi.\n\nIt opens at 530.. we get there at 515 and there's a line ...

The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi, 6 regular rolls, 2 larger ones, 2 slices of sashimi on rice, some kind of mayo based salad, miso soup, and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\n     For dinner, I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome, it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go, so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables, and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good, but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy are the pork katsu-don, ramen, curry katsu, and the agedashi dofu is excellent. Really, no matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. \n    On a rare occasion, most likely in the winter, be sure to check out the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna), be sure to get it without any questions, and do not get the roll, just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth every penny.\n    Overall, Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices, Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place.

If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi, that's fine, cause I know the food more than makes up for it.\n\nThat said, I know this place is hit or miss. My sister and I absolutely loved the place, as did my Japanese roommates (always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do.) But, my brother and sister-in-law weren't too impressed. I think Musashi is good, solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light, crisp, with a flavorful, but not too salty, sauce. The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice. There is also a special Japanese menu, with \"snacks\" which make great accompaniments to beer and sake, or if you're in the mood for \"tapas\". I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue. There's also an excellent sukiyaki. The lunchtime bento boxes were also very good.\n\nYou gotta understand. When you're living in Charlotte, there's not much in the way of Japanese food. And when you've been to Japan three or four times, you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls. That's where Musashi comes in. They've got more than just the same standard sushi, udon, teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US. And they don't try to get too fancy. \n\nAnd try to remember, its all about the food. Not about the lines, not the lack of greeting when you enter, not the crazy eyed lady who doesn't call you \"honey.\" It's the food.", "user_id": "OJ0GZT3g_Ihpspw4MUyctg", "review_id": "7HTA_U1JHN6GYv5bEcAfMQ", "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}, {"stars": 4.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2014-04-14 22:58:38", "text": "Best Japanese restaurant I've found in Charlotte so far.

Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.

We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again.

It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.

As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.

It tasted like wasabi, but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy, but good.  The pork was a bit tough.  \n\nThey have a whole list of special appetizers, but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation, but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them, so we dropped the conversation on it. \n\nMy gut tells me this place has very good, and very authentic Japanese food, but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.  \n\nOn to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.  \n\nMusashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.  \n\nWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily, and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink, no typical white-fat lines....  why?\n\nThe rolls come in pieces of 3, which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up, as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you. \n\nWe have not been back.

I frequent this restaurant on a weekly/bi-weekly basis :)", "user_id": "gRvkP3KoH4NHiTg5bDwoxA", "review_id": "x0DNNdiB3I0tTXQ0SaPbeQ", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}, {"stars": 5.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2014-08-09 01:17:31", "text": "Delicious worth the drive from Huntersville.

While it is in a strip mall, once we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and told to sit anywhere. The first thoughts we had were of Japan while looking at the decor. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Absolutely no complaint about service here!\n\n We have been here twice. The first time, we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect - served with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms, half an egg, three pieces of pork that were very tender, a piece of fish cake, and noodles with a lovely chewy texture. The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm, inviting flavor. \n\nThe second visit, I got the tonkatsu ramen again, while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu, 4pc. California roll, 2 shrimp tempora, 4 pc. vegetable tempora, a seaweed salad, miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, and an egg roll. Needless to say, we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals, plus sweetened tea for two, came to almost 42.00. For the atmosphere, the friendly service, and the authentic food, I can't wait to go back and try the river eel over rice!

Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \n\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that's unsurprising.\n\nMusashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:\n\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\n- Anago - delicious, buttery\n- ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch\n- surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\n- saba - marinated and tasty\n- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \n\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish", "user_id": "RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw", "review_id": "V1vJvgU5u6-WVPcMecd4mw", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}, {"stars": 4.0, "cool": 0, "date": "2014-03-29 01:30:02", "text": "Tried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  We had the vegetable tempura, tonkotsu ramen, and chicken katsu cutlet.  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.\n\nPros:\n\n- The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese, but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know, this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups.\n-It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise. \n-Service was good, and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer.\n-Price is reasonable, perhaps a touch high.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan.\n-The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky, presumably from spilled food/drink.\n-The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables, which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic, containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.", "user_id": "3iItddFlMfmqyQpPbjqI7g", "review_id": "ggcefrAkzG7ifAcyRH_Q8g", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}], "business_id": "gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ"}
