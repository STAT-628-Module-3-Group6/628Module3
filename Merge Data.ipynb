A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiter/waitresses are overworked, impatient, unattentive.  Emerald Chinese is no exception.  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient.  All our services needs were met, but the staff was rushed and grumpy..\\n\\nDecor\\nEmerald has tasteful decorations, comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths.

We orders bok choy, chicken fried rice and some lemon chicken. When we got our food the chicken was hard and looked old like it had been refried. So i complained to the server, he didn't even acknowledge my complaint and just left. i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one. Finally, a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old. But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy. By the time they brought it out we just weren't hungry anymore, considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold. Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude. One server, even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left. We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry. Disgusting, will not return.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.\\n\\nMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.\\n\\n*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. \\n\\nThe staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.\\n\\nThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.\\n\\nThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat.\",\n",

And I have to say, this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunch.\\n\\nFirst of all, the place is HUGE. My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings, events, gatherings, and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time, it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated, but maybe this has changed?\\n\\nFOOD! I honestly think it's great here, though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum, letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person, so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol), the siu mai, dumplings, they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here, they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.\\n\\nSERVICE is all pretty good too imo, a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too, bringing drinks/sauces/plates when we ask right away. \\n\\n\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to people! The reason it's a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing; often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them. However, I love coming back at lunch, I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience. Actually I go almost every week and I've not noticed any drop in quality, so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for now!\",\n",

There weren't any lines during the time we were there, but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before. The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly. I can't really blame them, I get it. When you have a good thing, capitalize on it. Though, this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I don't particularly find enjoyable.\\n\\nThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good. When it comes to dim sum, they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant. Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish. Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be. Again, a symptom of the style of restaurant. \\n\\nService was perfunctory at best. Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares. Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it (in as few words as possible).\\n\\nOverall, 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be. But the food is actually not bad.\",\n",

I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.\\n\\nNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out.

You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price. Some dim sum items are $6 a plate which I don't think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost.

Another staple, the shiu mai, was also pretty bad. It was tasty usually but it was tiny and I\\'m not sure if it had any fish egg topping either. If it did, it wasn\\'t noticeable. The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year. Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing, there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it. We also ordered some fried pork & veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold. The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess. Stuff like this should be basic! The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce. The xiao long bao was also decent.\\n\\nOverall, it seems like they\\'re skimping on everything that costs money now.

The food runs out quickly, so don't wait for it to come around again, it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings), Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce.

I would have preferred ordering from a menu, but co-workers who aren't dim sum regulars like the push-cart style so they can peek before ordering \\n\\nSelection -- good, aplenty on seafood dishes (steamed shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp with chives dumpling, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp with chives dumpling, .... you get the gist). They have all the usual suspects for dim sum. \\n\\nQuality -- okay. Because it's always busy, we've not had un-fresh food. \\n\\nService -- so so. I think they try to be efficient, if not warm and attentive. The servers are always in such a rush, who's got time to smile at or chat with you?! If you want something, just be assertive and flag someone down (in a polite way). \\n\\nWait Time -- avoid 11:45 - 12:45 peak lunch time.

Sometimes they respond to me, but they look the other way, I'm okay with that too. \\n\\nBut today we went, and I would ask people for tea, and cutlery and things, and they would put a grump face and storm away, only to come back with the minimal amount of things. \\n\\nI mean, we asked for hot sauce, and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyone's bowls! I was shocked, and then so I asked for more bowls. And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl. (What about everyone else)\\n\\nSome other servers are quite nice. If you need anything, try to flag down the guy in the suit/tie or the ladies in the black blazers. Anyone else will just throw things at you (figuratively)\\n\\nThey also again, tried to put stuff on our table, and I had to tell them to take it back. When she was confused what i wanted, I got yelled at. \\n\\nI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better. It would be the managers serving you, not the others. \\n\\nNonetheless, the place is always packed full of the local asian folk, which is a good thing. I can understand why, it's cheap, and the food is quite decent (they can cook the short ribs a bit more).  This time with 5 people, we paid $11 a person. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the only dim sum place in proximity, and my co-workers loving it so much, I wouldn't come back. \\nI really don't need to be treated like a 2nd class citizen.\",\n",

I tried some of those foods that the workmates had called up on the table as we were haring the bills and everything from the rice, to the chicken, to every single thing was terrible!

Anyhow, we generally try not to come here as it's not a great Chinese restaurant but it's one of the very few Chinese restaurants that can hold a large group.  \\n\\nWe arrived with a table of 10 and we had reservations.  After being confused why we were told we had a 40 minute when we had reservations, we finally sat down after talking to the head hostess for 20 minutes.  This didn't start off our meal on the right foot,\\n\\nWe choose a smaller 'banquet' meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didn't like the really big banquet dinners.  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in 'service'.  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls.  This behaviour continued throughout the meal.  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table.  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishes.\\n\\nThough they weren't outstanding or great.... all the dishes were fairly well executed.  Nothing was greasy, oily, underseasoned, overseasoned, or burnt.  Steamed fish was fresh and light.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist.  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy.  The lobster could be better... it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there.  All in all ... nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered.  \\n\\nIn comparison to the east end, this restaurant is probably just average but since we're in Mississauga, it stands to be one of the better ones.  It's too bad we don't have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurant.\",\n",

Food is never far away, if you see something that you like you'd better get it because the place is packed and it might not be there the next time the cart comes around. The food is good although not the best by most standards. Most of the time the food is fried so you can forget about individual flavors. Thankfully there is quite an amazing variety of foods and it is fresh. I loved the octopus as well as the wonton. Chicken feet were available so the wife was impressed. We got there late(230pm)so DimSum was wrapping up and as I said earlier the staff were in the midst of transforming the dining room, the staff is on point!\",\n",

Although the decor is nice with bright lights, white tablecloths and golden chair covers, it\\'s ultimate downfall is the food. \\n\\nThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried. Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls? Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart. Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing. Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin. These were very thick. \\n\\nI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a \"shrimp biscuit\". I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground pork.\\n\\nThe staff were awful. Apart from yelling at each other from across the room, they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice. \\n\\nOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us. After asking for the fried noodles on her cart, she stamped our card, then said she would get us a warm plate. She disappeared, and we didn\\'t see her again. We were about to ask someone about this, when another lady came with a plate of noodles. They were microwaved!!!! \\n\\nI think it\\'s safe to say I\\'ll never come back here again. There are so many other good dim sum places (Richmond Hill/Markham) that are definitely worth the drive. Do yourself a favour and don\\'t eat here.',\n",

It was extremely packed - a pretty long wait time I would assume. Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant: less wait time, attentive service, and the tea surcharge is waived. \\n\\nI generally go here because of the hustle & bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality. Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted? Probably not, but I still enjoy it because it's still one of the best, most popular, and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga (it's always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion - it indicates food is always made fresh for customers). If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town, this place is it! There's not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh & hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period (many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet, so it may take away from the experience if you've never tried this).\\n\\nIf you've never been to dim sum, I think going here would be a good experience. It's nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible. Some of the dishes I order regularly are: XO stir fried rice noodle rolls, spare ribs in black bean sauce, fried crab claw (a bit expensive, ~$5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure), fried seaweed roll.\\n\\nOnly negatives about this place could be: long wait times, not for people who dislike busy/loud environments, not for extremely starving people (you might have to wait if you can't find something you like right away on a cart), specialty/large dishes are expensive, not very wheelchair accessible (I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurant/plaza isn't that friendly for wheelchairs)\",\n",

Ordered two dishes from the \"create your own set dinner\" menu - the braised beef brisket and tendon bowl and the soft scrambled eggs with seafood. Came with house soup (老火湯) and dessert (綠豆沙 and orange slices).\\n\\nThe braised beef was very good, if not a bit oily. The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked - not too mushy and not too crunchy. The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable (I would have expected a root vegetable, like carrots or turnips), but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquid.\\n\\nThe eggs were a bit uneven, with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked. The seafood (shrimp and scallop) was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily (but it\\'s kind of to be expected with this dish).\\n\\nThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soup.\\n\\nService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves. \\n\\nPrices were reasonable.\\n\\nOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents... but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if you\\'re willing to go all the way east to Markham/Scarborough/etc.',\n",

If you're not very good at saying No, lol you're so screwed it's not even funny.\\n\\nEmerald is (as has been described to me) a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place. This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers, YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. \\n\\nThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times, you just have to be patient. The ladies (never seen a dude wheeling the carts) will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table (for which you will be charged), so you have to say No multiple times. \\n\\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin. I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily, the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different, so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I'd find growing between my toenails, but tasted like heaven should taste. Leave your inhibitions at home.\\n\\nIt is WELL worth it. I'm now a huge fan of pork dumplings (as seen in other posts) and glazed pork buns! I can even order for myself now without going all doe-eyed in the face of the waiters! (I'm pretty proud of that)\\n\\nTL;DR: Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this. Learn to say No. Leave your inhibitions at home.\",\n",

The decor... Weird looking yellow chairs, ceiling has water/mold stains and the TV is showing Slice.\\n\\nWe were taken to our table by a middle-aged Asian man, who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language, as he spoke like Dr. Frankenstein's monster. There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty. Then another manager, this time a female, approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings. We said yes, but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart, that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  \\n\\nNow, as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout, there is a price hike, supposedly because you are getting more food, so don't be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.\\n\\nThe rice was just plain crap. No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice. The vegetables were the size of my fist (exaggerated), but damn folks, could you not cut them down to a manageable size?!\\n\\nAll that and I'm now $40 in the hole. No tip either, since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste and/or try to shovel it off to someone else.

I felt like we were begging for food and service attention at this restaurant; I don't know how about you, but to me, it just killed my appetite. We ordered deep fried oyster, sea-food fried rice, fried noodle, spicy scallop and pecking duck. And I have to say, these were one of the worst Chinese dishes ( I rated Mandarin 3 stars-so you know I am not a picky eater here).

       "   'text': 'This is as close as you can get to Hong Kong dim sum here in Mississauga.\\n\\nI have been eating here for almost 10 years. Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so I\\'m a little behind. The place is huge - banquet style seating. They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so it\\'s very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTA.\\n\\nThe choice is yours: Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu. From their \"Har Gau\" shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings, you can always find something good to eat here. When I first arrived at Emerald, I didn\\'t quite know what to expect. It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby. What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy. I am telling you all, the food is very good here.\\n\\nDim sum carts: Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay. Noodles and veggies are cheaper. Seafood items are higher in cost. If you love seafood as much as I do, you won\\'t mind paying for it.\\n\\nMenu: I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great. If you order the crab, it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget. When dining here with out-of-town family or friends, I would always recommend buying the crab.\\n\\nSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment. You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service. As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays, I\\'m listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the \"five-star\" eating experience.\\n\\nTip #1: Plan wisely - Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse. Unless you are absolutely craving their food, beware of rushed and rude service.\\nTip #2: All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts. You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price. But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out. The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours. I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishes.\\nTip #3: When you need some service, get their attention! Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests. They are the ones you need to order from so don\\'t be shy and call them over. \\nTip #4: When asking for something, no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you. When speaking with us needy/hungry/polite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders. Just say what you need and follow up when they forget. If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcome.\\n\\nFor more food reviews and blogging, check out my blog at https://spicychopsticks.blog',\n",

Sometimes, I wonder how useful it is to do a u-turn instead of turning left at the intersection. \\n\\nThis plaza gets busy. We got there just before noon, so we were fine. \\n\\nWe got a round table. There were seven of us. We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle. \\n\\nWe ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there! So much for pacing how much we eat. \\n\\nThe dim sum was delicious. Some of my favourites are the following:\\n- Crab claw balls (so good, especially the meat in the claw)\\n- Har gow\\n- Sticky rice in fragrant leaves\\n- Rice rolls (shrimp and barbeque pork)\\n\\nI had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish. I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish. \\n\\nWe split the bill. Each person ended up paying $22, which included the tip. I was good with it. My boss said that it was expensive. This restaurant accepts credit, debit, and cash. \\n\\nThe dim sum quality was amazing. This restaurant houses a ton of people. At one point, a tour bus full of tourists came in. I would guess that it easily seats 200 people. \\n\\nI'd come back here again. It's fully licensed, which is another reason why I need to come back.  \\n\\n(215)\",\n",

It was perfectly cooked, very light, very big, very yummy, and there was so much of it I struggled to finish. My boyfriend ordered the sweet & sour chicken with noodles and they were both great. Definitely recommend for a fun night out to much with friends :) \\n\\nP.S. They serve you green tea in a little pot when you're first seated, and orange slices and fortune cookies after your meal.\",\n",

Only downside was that we had a large party, and when a cart comes by, we'd take a couple of plates, but all the food would be gone in a minute.

The restaurant was about half full.  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs.  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged. \\n\\nWe ordered one of the set menus for $88 which included:\\n\\n- House soup\\n\\n- 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions.  I don't eat crab that often but it's probably one of the best I've tasted.  Lots of meat, not too much work needed to dig it out.  The meat was very fresh and not overdone.  \\n\\n- Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skin\\n\\n- Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushrooms\\n\\n- Fish and deep fry tofu\\n\\n- Stirfry tung choi\\n\\nIn addition, we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chicken.\\n\\nFood came fast and super hot.  Portions were gigantic especially the tofu/fish and snow pea leaves dishes.  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menu.\\n\\nDessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet taro/tapioca soup.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people.  We had 2 jumbo containers of leftovers with the bill coming to $140 before tip.\",\n",

However it is our favorite place to go when we have a hunkering for Dim-Sum. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is good, and price is right. A la cart is also very good and there are a lot of good traditional Chinese dishes, same as you would find in China. I enjoy Emerald. Ask for TsingTao beer with your meal, and try the pork belly and  and also the lobster dishes.',\n",

The restaurant was extremely busy but we still managed to get a table right away. \\n\\nThe first thing I was confused about was how it worked. I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you. Also, I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter. Even after that I wasn't sure as most of them can't speak English so it was hard to communicate. \\n\\nThe food itself wasn't bad. It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything, just satisfied. We tried a few things (including chicken feet) which was an interesting experience. The spices on the chicken feet tasted good, but there was almost no meat on it (I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty). I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was something new to me but the food doesn't leave me wanting more. I was drinking water like crazy for the next 3 hours after as the meal left me extremely thirsty (MSG?) \\n\\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you really want to try traditional dim sum once.\",\n",

Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds, fish tank, things weren't new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.\\n\\nThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular à la carte menu. My table ordered off the à la carte, probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.\\n\\nThe soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible, but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place, literally.\\n\\nOther dishes came out eventually, featuring sweet and sour pork, thousand island sauce deep fried pork, egg tofu with baby shrimp, garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce, XO sauce string beans, fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home, but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done, though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard, nothing special.\\n\\nI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either, which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party. Personally - I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill, but for being in Mississauga it wasn't bad at all.\",\n",

Good, but not exceptional. \\n\\nWhy won't I come back again?

Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lot.\\n\\nPrices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a days.\\n\\nDecor needs an update... if anyone cares. And also, theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive (its hard to use the term friendly because they weren't lol) when we came in and our service was prompt.\\n\\nParking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full. \\n\\nOverall, not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go either.\",\n",
